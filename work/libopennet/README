Libopennet allows you to open_net()  urls (or files, for that matter) the same
way you would normally open() just files.

Example:
	#include <opennet.h>
	int fd;
	char buf[512];

	fd=open_net("http://www.rkeene.org/", O_RDONLY);
	read_net(fd, &buf, 512);  /* You could just read() it, but read_net 
                                  tries harder to get all 512 bytes. */
	lseek_net(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);
	close(fd);



open_net() even parses URLs for certain things:
          @@OSNM@@ = OS Name (linux, freebsd, sunos, etc)
          @@OSVR@@ = OS version (2.2.x, 4.2, 5.8, etc)
          @@OSVS@@ = OS version (short) (2.2, 4.2, 5.8, etc)
          @@ARCH@@ = Arch (i386, sparc64, sun4u, sun4m, etc)
          @@DIST@@ = If OSNM=Linux, distribution of Linux.
          @@ATSN@@ = Put an `@'

So you could open_net("http://www.@@OSNM@@.com/", O_RDONLY);

LIMITATIONS:
open_net() only does READ-ONLY with HTTP, and READ or WRITE with FTP (not both)
libopennet doesn't do mailto:, or anything besides http and ftp for that matter.
